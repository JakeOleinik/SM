# Split metrics G-test

This is an short excerpt of the code written for [Split Metrics](http://splitmetrics.com) during my remote internship there.

It is a Python implementation of statistical [G-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-test) for multiple versions, returning the winning version and confidence level.
The test has many potential applications (ex. to determine the version of website during A/B testing, generating most conversions).
